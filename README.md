👋 Hello there! I'm Marco, a passionate software engineer with expertise in .NET, C#, JavaScript, and Angular. I'm dedicated to crafting robust and innovative solutions to tackle complex problems. Here's a glimpse of what you'll find in my GitHub:

### 💼 Professional Background:

- 🌐 Over 17 years of experience in software development.
- 💻 Proficient in .NET technologies, including ASP.NET Core and Framework.
- 🚀 Extensive experience with C# for backend development.
- 🌟 Frontend expertise in JavaScript and Angular for building interactive web applications.
- 📦 Skilled in designing and implementing RESTful APIs and microservices architectures.
- 🧪 Strong testing and debugging skills to ensure code quality.
- 🌐 Knowledgeable in DevOps practices and CI/CD pipelines.

### 📦 Featured Projects:

1. [eShopOnMicroservices](https://github.com/maffalcao/eShopOnMicroservices): This reference application is cross-platform at the server and client-side, thanks to .NET 7 services capable of running on Linux or Windows containers depending on your Docker host, and to Xamarin for mobile apps running on Android, iOS, or Windows/UWP plus any browser for the client web apps. The architecture proposes a microservice oriented architecture implementation with multiple autonomous microservices (each one owning its own data/db) and implementing different approaches within each microservice (simple CRUD vs. DDD/CQRS patterns) using HTTP as the communication protocol between the client apps and the microservices and supports asynchronous communication for data updates propagation across multiple services based on Integration Events and an Event Bus

2. [https://github.com/maffalcao/EWeatherInfo](EWeatherInfo): This project aims to develop a scalable weather data retrieval system using .NET Core and C# while adhering to Clean Architecture principles. It employs Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts to ensure code reliability and integrates with Azure Blob Storage to fetch meteorological information generated by global weather stations, making it a robust solution for weather data access.

### 🌱 What I'm Currently Learning:

Currently, I am actively expanding my skill set by delving into several exciting technologies and concepts. I'm immersing myself in Angular v16, exploring Astro.js for efficient web development, and keeping pace with the latest advancements in .NET by diving into .NET 7. Additionally, I'm dedicating time to mastering various design patterns to enhance my software design and architecture skills.

### 📚 Favorite Technologies:
